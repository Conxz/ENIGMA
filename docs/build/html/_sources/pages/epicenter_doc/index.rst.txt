Epicenter mapping
======================================

This page contains descriptions and examples to identify disease epicenters!


Cortical epicenters
---------------------
Using the :ref:`HCP connectivity data <hcp_connectivity>`, we can also identify epicenters of cortical atrophy.
This is done by systematically correlating every cortical region's seed-based connectivity profile (*i.e.*, cortico-cortical connectivity) with 
a whole-brain atrophy map. Disease epicenters thus represent regions whose connectivity profile 
spatially resembles the disease-related atrophy map. In this tutorial, our *atrophy map* will be 
derived from cortical thickness decreases in individuals with left TLE.


.. admonition:: Epicenter whaaat? ü§î

     Cortical and subcortical epicenter regions are identified if their connectivity profiles correlate with a disease-specific *cortical* atrophy map. 
     In the following examples, regions with strong *negative* correlations represent disease epicenters. Moreover, and regardless of its atrophy level, 
     a cortical or subcortical region can be an epicenter if it is (*i*) strongly connected to other high-atrophy cortical regions and (*ii*) weakly connected 
     to low-atrophy cortical regions.

     For completeness, we include code that has been detailed elsewhere (:ref:`loading example data <load_ct>`,
     :ref:`z-scoring and visualizing cortical surface data <surf_visualization>`). 
     If you're already comfortable with these steps, feel free to simply skip right to the last two sections!

Subcortical epicenters
-------------------------
To identify subcortical epicenters of cortical atrophy, we once again correlate every subcortical region's seed-based 
connectivity profile (*e.g.*, subcortico-cortical connectivity) with 
a whole-brain cortical atrophy map. As above, our *atrophy map* will be 
derived from cortical thickness decreases in individuals with left TLE.

     For completeness, we include code that has been detailed elsewhere (:ref:`loading example data <load_ct>`,
     :ref:`z-scoring and visualizing cortical surface data <surf_visualization>`). Sections 1-3 are identical to 
     the above example for identifying cortical epicenters.
