Epicenter mapping
======================================

This page contains descriptions and examples to identify disease epicenters!


Cortical epicenters
---------------------
Using the :ref:`HCP connectivity data <hcp_connectivity>`, we can also identify epicenters of atrophy.
This is done by systematically correlating every region's seed-based connectivity profile with 
a whole-brain atrophy map. Disease epicenters thus represent regions whose connectivity profile 
spatially resembles the disease-related atrophy map. In this tutorial, our *atrophy map* will be 
derived from cortical thickness decreases in individuals with left TLE.
