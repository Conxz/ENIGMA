**ENIGMA TOOLBOX**
============================
*An open source repository for the sharing of neuroimaging and genetics data, analytical
codes, and visualization tools that are 100% ENIGMA-friendly and -focused.*


___________________________________________________________________________________________________

**Data sharing** üíå
--------------------------
As part of the **ENIGMA TOOLBOX**, we are making several data matrices openly available! As of now, 
these include :ref:`functional and structural connectivity data<hcp_connectivity>` as well as :ref:`transcriptomic data<gene_maps>`.

**Harmonization of analytical methods** üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
--------------------------------------------------------
Why make all these codes and data available, you may ask? One key goal of the **ENIGMA TOOLBOX** is
to harmonize analytical methods both *within* and *across* ENIGMA Working Groups, ultimately facilitating
comparisons of imaging and genetic findings across diseases.

**Visualization tools** üé®
-------------------------------------
Tired of displaying your surface findings in tables? Look no further! The **ENIGMA TOOLBOX** has got you 
covered! Check out our :ref:`visualization tools<surf_visualization>` and project your cortical and subcortical data to the surface!

**Step-by-step tutorials** üë£
------------------------------------
The **ENIGMA TOOLBOX** has a *No data, No problem* policy! To make things easier, we provide :ref:`example data<load_ct>` that
have been processed according to ENIGMA protocols. Using these example data, you can complete all of the  
tutorials. Alternatively, easily replace our example data with other ENIGMA-derived datasets!

**Development and getting involved** ‚öôÔ∏è
-------------------------------------------
Should you have any problems, questions, or suggestions about the **ENIGMA TOOLBOX**, please do not
hesitate to post them to our Github `issues <https://github.com/MICA-MNI/ENIGMA/issues>`_! Or are you interested in collaborating 
or sharing your ENIGMA-related codes/tools? `Noice <https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=noice>`_! 
Make sure you familiarize yourself with our `contributing guidelines <https://github.com/MICA-MNI/ENIGMA/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_ 
first and then discuss your ideas on our Github `issues <https://github.com/MICA-MNI/ENIGMA/issues>`_ and 
`pull request <https://github.com/MICA-MNI/ENIGMA/pulls>`_.
