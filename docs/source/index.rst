**ENIGMA TOOLBOX**
============================
*An open source repository for the sharing of neuroimaging and genetics data, analytical
codes, and visualization tools that are 100% ENIGMA-friendly and -focused.*

**Data sharing** üíå
--------------------------
   As part of the **ENIGMA TOOLBOX**, we are making several data matrices openly available! As of now, 
   these include :ref:`functional and structural connectivity data<hcp_connectivity>` as well as :ref:`transcriptomic data<gene_maps>`.

**Harmonization of analytical methods** üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
--------------------------------------------------------
   Why make all these codes and data available, you may ask? One key goal of the **ENIGMA TOOLBOX** is
   to harmonize analytical methods both *within* and *across* ENIGMA Working Groups, ultimately facilitating
   comparisons of imaging and genetic findings across diseases.

**Visualization tools** üé®
-------------------------------------
   Tired of displaying your surface findings in tables? Look no further! The **ENIGMA TOOLBOX** has got you 
   covered! Check out our :ref:`visualization tools<surf_visualization>` and project your cortical and subcortical data to the surface!

**Step-by-step tutorials** üë£
------------------------------------
   The **ENIGMA TOOLBOX** has a *No data, No problem* policy! To make things easier, we provide :ref:`example data<load_ct>` that
   have been processed according to ENIGMA protocols. Using these example data, you can complete all of the  
   tutorials. Alternatively, easily replace our example data with other ENIGMA-derived datasets!
