HCP connectivity data
======================================

This page contains descriptions and examples to use HCP connectivity data!


Cortical connectivity matrices
---------------
The **ENIGMA TOOLBOX** provides structural (obtained from diffusion MRI) and functional 
(obtained from resting-state functional MRI) connectivity matrices. Following the examples below, we can 
load and explore various connectivity metrics and easily map them to the surface.

   .. code-tab:: matlab

        %% ...  




Subcortical connectivity matrices
---------------
| Subcortico-cortical as well as subcortico-subcortical connectivity matrices are also included in the
 **ENIGMA TOOLBOX**! As above, we can load these structural and functional matrices and project them to the surface!
