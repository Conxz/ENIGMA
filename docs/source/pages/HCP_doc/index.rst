Connectivity matrices
======================================

This page contains descriptions and examples to use HCP connectivity data!


Cortical connectivity matrices
--------------------------------------
The **ENIGMA TOOLBOX** provides structural (diffusion MRI) and functional 
(resting-state functional MRI) connectivity matrices obtained from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). 
Following the examples below, we can load and explore various connectivity metrics as well as easily 
map them to the surface (please also see :ref:`surface_visualization`).

   .. code-tab:: py
       
        >>> ...


   .. code-tab:: matlab

        %% ...  




Subcortical connectivity matrices
---------------------------------------
| Subcortico-cortical as well as subcortico-subcortical connectivity matrices are also included in the
 **ENIGMA TOOLBOX**! As above, we can load these structural and functional matrices and project them to the surface!
