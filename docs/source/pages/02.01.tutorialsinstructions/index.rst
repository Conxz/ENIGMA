Usage notes
======================================

| The **ENIGMA TOOLBOX** includes a set of commonly used tools accompanied by validated, ready-to-use, and easy-to-follow code snippets. 
        These code snippets will guide you through each step, starting from loading ENIGMA-derived datasets to visualizing findings from advanced secondary analyses.

| To accomodate a larger scientific audience, we present code snippets in both *Python* and *Matlab*. Tutorials in the **ENIGMA TOOLBOX** are also compatible 
        with individual site data or data derived from a mega-analysis (**mega**) as well as data obtained from a meta-analytical studies (**meta**). 
        Each available options are presented in their respective tabs as follows: 

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: **Python** | meta
     
   .. tab:: **Matlab** | meta

   .. tab:: ⤎ ⤏

          | ⤎ If you have **meta**-analysis data (*e.g.*, summary statistics)
          | ⤏ If you have individual site or **mega**-analysis data

   .. tab:: **Python** | mega

   .. tab:: **Matlab** | mega


Some tutorials may have specific prerequisite steps; if that is the case, we provided the links to the steps you must complete first as follows:
